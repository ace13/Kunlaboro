So I see you've stumbled upon this little project of mine.
Kunlaboro - which is esperanto and means *cooperation* - is a C++ Entity-Component System licensed under the MIT license.

Currently undergoing a rewrite to provide a higher performance data-driven approach to components, while still providing a high-level message passing system.

Requirements
------------

Kunlaboro is built using many C++11 and 14 features, therefore it requires a reasonably modern compiler to work properly.

Current development is done on Visual Studio 2015, with additional testing on GCC-4.9. Other compilers that support C++14 will most likely also work.

Code Examples
-------------

Coming soon...
